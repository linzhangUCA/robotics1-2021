Note:
1. Use a LiPo battery charger with a balancing module.
2. **NEVER** Leave a Battery Charging Unattended!
3. The safest charge rate is the capacity of battery in Amps.
4. A LiPo cell should NEVER be discharged below 3.0V.
5. Don't throw your LiPo battery in the trash after discharging it - seek out a recycler.
